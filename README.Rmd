# libminer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of libminer is to provide an overview of your R library setup. It is a toy package created as a part of workshop and not meant for real use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-vestcor/libminer")
```

## Example

To get a count of installed packages in each of your libraries ontionally
with the total sizes use `lib_summary()`

```{r example}
library(libminer)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
